Project: Connect Four with Monte Carlo Tree Search on an Arduino Mega 2560
Date: April 10, 2020

Folders included:
Arduino
Computer

Files in Arduino:
CFArduino.cpp (connect four game class for the arduino)
CFArduino.h (header file for CFArduino.cpp)
connectFourArduino.cpp (main file for program)
Makefile (used to compile code in the command line)

Files in Computer:
ConnectFour.cpp (connect 4 game class)
ConnectFour.h (header file for ConnectFour.cpp)
connectFourComputer.cpp (main program)
ConnectNode.cpp (tree node class for MCTS)
ConnectNode.h (header file for ConnectNode.cpp)
Makefile (used to compile code)
mcts.cpp (main driver of Monte Carlo tree search algorithm)
mcts.h (header file for mcts.cpp)
serialport.cpp (functions provided by Alberta CMPUT 275 class for serial communication)
serialport.h (header file for serialport.cpp)


note: I always run this in a command line interface that already has the arduino toolchain installed.


To run the program:
1. Ensure connectFourArduino has been loaded onto the arduino
2. In the 'Computer' directory, use 'make' to compile executable for desktop.
3. With the arduino connected to the computer, run the program "connectFourComputer"
4. The program will only run if it can find the arduino, otherwise it will end.
5. If the program starts, use the UI on the Arduino to start a game.
